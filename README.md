## 1. Project Overview

The **RentMAX WhatsApp Log Processor & Zoho CRM Integration** project automates the ingestion, processing, and synchronization of WhatsApp chat logs (from WATI) into Zoho CRM. The system:
- Receives messages via a secure webhook.
- Persists the messages in log files.
- Processes logs to extract structured tenant journey data.
- Updates existing leads in Zoho CRM based on matching Mobile and Lead_Source ("WATI") without creating duplicates.
- Uses OAuth 2.0 for secure API communication.
- Runs scheduled jobs via APScheduler.

## 2. System Architecture and Workflow

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

The system consists of three primary layers:
1. **Data Ingestion:** A Flask app (`app.py`) handles incoming webhooks and OAuth callbacks.
2. **Data Processing:** A scheduled job reads log files and extracts journey data using logic in `rentmax_analysis.py`.
3. **Data Integration:** Processed data is pushed to Google Sheets (for backup) and updates existing Zoho CRM leads.
